# Ranking Algorithm

## Introduction

There are many ways to rank a set of entities given results of one-on-one games between them. The NFL and NBA have a deterministic method to determine which teams make the playoffs, looking at record, division, and head-to-head matchups. The ATP uses a point system to determine world tennis rankings. College sports, on the other hand, typically relies on committees to make ranking decisions.

There is a lot of controversy behind some decisions made by college sports committees. However, it is difficult to rely on something as simple as win-loss record to determine college rankings due to a wide variety of schedules.

My personal opinion is that the most important quality of a ranking should be consistency; i.e., if $A$ wins against $B$, $A$ should be ranked higher than $B$. I propose a new ranking system which prioritizes consistency above all else. This is a work in progress.
