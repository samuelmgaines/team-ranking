# Ranking Algorithm

## Introduction

There are many ways to rank a set of entities given results of one-on-one games between them. The NFL and NBA have a deterministic method to determine which teams make the playoffs, looking at record, division, and head-to-head matchups. The ATP uses a point system to determine world tennis rankings. College sports, on the other hand, typically relies on committees to make ranking decisions.

There is a lot of controversy behind some decisions made by college sports committees. However, it is difficult to rely on something as simple as win-loss record to determine college rankings due to a wide variety of schedules.

My personal opinion is that the most important quality of a ranking should be consistency; that is, if $A$ wins against $B$, $A$ should be ranked higher than $B$. I propose a new ranking system which prioritizes consistency above all else. This is a work in progress.

## The Ranking System

### Competitors, Games, and Ranks

Suppose we have $n$ competitors labelled $c_1, c_2, ..., c_n$.

Define a game as an ordered pair of two different competitors. For a game $(c_i, c_j)$, we say that competitor $c_i$ is the winner and competitor $c_j$ is the loser. Let $G$ be a collection of $m$ not necessarily unique games.

Let $r_i$ be the integer rank of competitor $c_i$ for each $i \in \{1,...,n\}$. It must be the case that $r_i \neq r_j$ for all unique $i, j \leq n$. It must also be the case that $1 \leq r_i \leq n$ for all $i \leq n$. In other words, each team should be assigned a unique integer rank from $1$ to $n$.

> [!NOTE]
> In this document, a "higher" rank indicates a lower number; i.e., if $r_1 = 4$ and $r_2 = 6$, we say $c_1$ is ranked higher than $c_2$.

### Objective

As stated in the Introduction, our biggest priority is consistency, or conversely, minimizing inconsistency. An inconsistency occurs when a competitor $c_i$ is ranked higher than another competitor $c_j$ despite $c_j$ having beaten $c_i$ in a game.

For each game $(c_i, c_j)$, we can compute an inconsistency score. If $r_i > r_j$, then we say the inconsistency score is $0$ (since this is a "consistent" game). However, if $r_i < r_j$, then we say the inconsistency score is $r_j - r_i$, i.e. the difference of the two teams' ranks. These two cases can be combined by saying the inconsistency score of a game $(c_i, c_j)$ is $max(0, r_j - r_i)$.

The total inconsistency score of the ranking is just the sum of all the inconsistency scores of the games. Our objective is to minimize this total inconsistency score. Combine this objective with the rank constraints outlined earlier, and we see the optimization problem $(1)$ that defines our ranking system.
